> learning and publishing meaningful open & general research using generative-ai

compendia labs is an **independent research lab** exploring ideas across AI, mathematics, biology, and beyond.  
the mission: **learn research by doing it** and publish everything openly.

---

## ğŸŒ± principles
- **open publishing** â†’ papers, notes, and experiments are shared freely.  
- **low compute, high impact** â†’ focus on rigor and creativity, not massive clusters.  
- **general curiosity** â†’ no fixed domain; from language models to pure math to biology.  
- **learn in public** â†’ mistakes, drafts, and dead ends are part of the process.  

---

## ğŸ“‚ projects
- **papers** â†’ arxiv preprints, notes, and exploratory work.  
- **code** â†’ reproducible experiments, datasets, and research utilities.  
- **logs** â†’ lab notebook, ideas in progress.

## ğŸ§­ vision
to prove that independent researchers can contribute meaningfully to science without billion-dollar budgets, by combining curiosity, discipline, and open tools.
